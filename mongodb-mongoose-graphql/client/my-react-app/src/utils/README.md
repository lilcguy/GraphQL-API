# Front End Utils

## Description
In the front end, this serves as the LITERAL QUERY that is used to query data from the GraphQL API. 
What I mean by that is like in the playground, when you are selecting the data you want to query, that is what is happening here
on the front end.

The queries defined here are what are sent to the API to receive data back.
